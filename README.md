# Blinkit Data Analysis Project   
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analysis of Blinkit (formerly Grofers) dataset using SQL, Excel, Python, and Power BI.

The goal is to clean, analyze, and visualize the data to derive business insights such as:  
-Identify top-performing products and categories.
-Analyze sales trends across time periods.

-Evaluate the impact of discounts and promotions on sales.  
-Track regional demand and inventory challenges.  
-Build interactive dashboards for decision-making.  
-Provide actionable recommendations for business growth.
